        <h2>How did it all start?</h2>
        <p>Beyond Academy was founded in 2019 by Ryan Walker, a former management consultant and serial entrepreneur who managed to turn things around for himself after dropping out of school at 16. Driven by a strong motivation to turn things around for himself, Ryan stayed persistent and pursued every opportunity he could to get ahead, eventually beating the odds and going on to have a thriving corporate career. This inspired Ryan to create Beyond Academy, empowering those just starting out on their professional journey to embark on a life-changing opportunity that would change the course of their future and allow them to get ahead in their careers.</p>
        <h2>Where can you find us?</h2>
        <p>We're a fully remote company - no traditional offices here! We mostly work from home (sometimes in our PJs when we can help it), but you'll also find us hanging out in co-working spaces or soaking up inspiration in trendy caf√©s. Don't let the casual vibe fool you though; every single one of us works hard to deliver on what we promise to you and make our fantastic programs a reality.</p>
        <h2>Who are the people behind Beyond?</h2>
        <p>We are a truly global team with over 50 people from 17 nationalities located across 14 countries! We come from various backgrounds and walks of life, yet share one thing in common - we live (or have lived) abroad, and embrace the transformative impact of travel, cultural immersion, diverse interactions, and unique experiences. It is this shared passion that unites us in our commitment to crafting programs that create life-changing opportunities.</p>
